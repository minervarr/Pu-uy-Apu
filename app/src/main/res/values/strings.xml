    PU√ëUY APU - SLEEP TRACKER APPLICATION STRINGS
    VERSION: 1.0 | PHASE: Foundation & Core Structure
    ========================================================================

    üåü CRITICAL NOTES FOR TRANSLATORS üåü

    1. üì± APP CONTEXT: This is a passive sleep tracking app that automatically
       detects when users sleep by monitoring phone usage patterns.
       "Pu√±uy Apu" means "Sleep Mountain" in Quechua (Andean indigenous language).

    2. üéØ TARGET AUDIENCE: Health-conscious individuals who want to understand
       their sleep patterns without manual tracking. Age range: 18-65,
       tech-comfortable users seeking wellness insights.

    3. üìù TONE GUIDELINES (CRITICAL):
       - Warm, encouraging, and supportive throughout
       - NEVER judgmental about sleep habits (people have different needs)
       - Health-focused but NOT medical/clinical language
       - Personal and friendly, like a caring friend
       - Optimistic about sleep improvement possibilities

    4. üîß TECHNICAL CONCEPTS - SIMPLIFY THESE:
       - "Passive detection" = "automatic tracking without manual input"
       - "Interaction patterns" = "how you use your phone"
       - "Sleep interruptions" = "times you briefly woke up"
       - "Confidence score" = "how sure we are about the data"

    5. üìè CHARACTER LIMITS (IMPORTANT):
       - Button text: Under 20 characters preferred
       - Notification titles: Under 50 characters
       - Dashboard summaries: Under 100 characters
       - Error messages: Clear and under 150 characters

    6. üîÄ PLACEHOLDER FORMATTING (DO NOT TRANSLATE):
       - %s = text replacement (times, names, etc.)
       - %d = number replacement (counts, hours, etc.)
       - %1$s, %2$s = multiple ordered text replacements
       - %.1f = decimal number with one decimal place
       These markers must remain EXACTLY as shown.

    7. üåç CULTURAL ADAPTATION GUIDELINES:
       - Sleep times vary by culture (adapt examples appropriately)
       - Work schedules differ (mention "shift work" considerations)
       - Some cultures have midday rest periods (acknowledge this)
       - Avoid assumptions about "normal" sleep times

    8. ‚ôø ACCESSIBILITY NOTES:
       - Screen reader users need descriptive text
       - Visual impairments require clear, specific descriptions
       - Cognitive accessibility: use simple, direct language

    9. üìã QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR TRANSLATORS:
       ‚úÖ Maintains encouraging, non-judgmental tone
       ‚úÖ Uses simple language for technical concepts
       ‚úÖ Respects character limits for UI elements

    üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE TRANSLATION MANAGEMENT

    VERSIONING STRATEGY:
    - Each major feature addition should increment version number
    - Track which strings are new vs modified vs deprecated
    - Maintain changelog of string changes for translator reference

    CONTEXT DOCUMENTATION:
    - Every string should have usage context documented
    - Include screenshots showing where strings appear
    - Note character limits and formatting constraints

    CULTURAL ADAPTATION CHECKLIST:
    - Sleep time examples appropriate for local culture
    - Work schedule assumptions (9-5 vs shift work vs flexible)
    - Health and wellness communication style
    - Privacy concern levels and communication approach

    QUALITY ASSURANCE:
    - Test all strings in UI with target language
    - Verify placeholder formatting works correctly
    - Check accessibility with screen readers in target language
    - Validate cultural appropriateness with native speakers
